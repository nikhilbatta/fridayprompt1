<h1> Why Did I Choose To Come To Epicodus?</h1>

<p class="job"> The reason I took my talents to Epicodus is because for the last 7 to 8 months I have been coding off and on by myself, learning a bunch of random stuff. I needed structure, I needed to develop basic fundamentals. You can't run unless you can walk first, and thats what I was trying to do. So far Epicodus has been great and the environment has really boosted my interest in coding.</p>
